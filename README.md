ABOUT THE PROJECT

This is a sample of some of the work I did on Chroma, my master's capstone project: a third-person rogue-lite shooter, developed in Unreal Engine 5. 


GAMEPLAY

Nadia, the main character, has a backpack with 6 batteries, which she can discharge one at a time with her primary weapon, a blaster. There are 7 types of batteries in the game, each with different abilities, that the player can swap in and out of her backpack. The player can collect upgrades for her batteries and movement abilities, allowing the player to customize their build.
